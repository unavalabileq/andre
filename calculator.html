			<h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Plan the calculator's functionality
Before you start coding, it's important to plan out what you want your calculator to do. In its simplest form, our calculator will be able to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
            </p>
            <p>
Step 2: Write the code to get user input
To allow the user to input the numbers and operators, we'll use the input() function. The input() function is a built-in function in Python that takes a string as an argument and displays it on the screen. The user can then type in their input, and the function returns the input as a string.
            </p>
<p>
Step 3: Write the code to perform arithmetic operations
Once we have the user input, we need to be able to perform the desired arithmetic operation. We'll use if statements to check which operation the user wants to perform and then use Python's built-in arithmetic operators to perform the calculation.

</p>
            <p>
Step 4: Display the result
Finally, we'll use the print() function to display the result of the calculation to the user.</p>
